This tiny site uses the [Screen Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API) to prevent your device from sleeping.

Where this API isn't supported, an empty silent video is played to emulate this behaviour (using [NoSleep.js](https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js)).
